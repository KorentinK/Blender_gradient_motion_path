# Blender_gradient_motion_path
Create a gradient motion path for Blender

Install : 

Put the Gradient_Path.zip everywhere you want in your computer (in documents for example) Then open Blender, Go to Edit => Preferences => Add-ons tab, 
Then click on the "Install..." button. Search after the Gradient_Path.zip then click on the "Install Add-on" button. 
The add-on should be installed, go to the "object properties" section and you will see a "Gradient motion path" tab. BE CAREFUL it has been designed
to work on the Blender 3.2.0 version (it should work from the 2.8 to the 3.2)

How it works : 

Simply enter the frame start and frame end, and click ont the "Create motion path" button. It could take several seconds if the scene is complex. 
Don't worry to be in object or in pose mode, the program detect it automatically and should permit you to track anything, even if it is parented or constrained.
If it doesn't work, feel free to send me a message.
Press "Escape" to erase the path, then click on the "Create motion path" button to redraw it. 

Tip : There is a keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + shift + F" that will do the same as click on the "Create motion path" button

Hope it can be helpfull !
